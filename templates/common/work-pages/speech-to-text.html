                            In 2013 I was very involved in working on a home automation/personal assistant (aptly named Jarvis).
                            This project has been in progress for a few years and is still something I would like to work on.
                            Jarvis currently works at a level that is close to what siri can do, but uses Google speech to text
                            to do lots of the heavy lifting.  I dream of creating my own context aware speech to text engine, combining
                            the NLP and speech to text process into one - but I haven't found the time to do that at this point.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most of the time I spent on this project was devoted to recording audio properly in order to have near
                            real-time feedback from the API endpoint, and NLP connected to a number of public APIs.
